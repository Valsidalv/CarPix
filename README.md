# CarPix
I made this as my first full-stack project after a long time. I normally work on front-end, but decided to give this a shot.
If nothing else, to understand a bit better what is happening on back-end.
So, in this project I made a car gallery. Sort of. What you can do is, look at uploaded images, add your own car images and add comments.
To do this, you need to register an account. Also, in order for this app to work, you need to install Mongodb on your local machine.
I think that explains it. Enjoy! :)
